Iot enabled Walking stick for visually impaired

The system senses obstacles using ultrasonic sensor and gives a buzz sound to aware user about the detected obstacle and its distance. It effectively calculates distance of the detected object from the person.This proposed system uses Arduino based embedded system to process real time data collected using ultrasonic sensor. The distance data from ultrasonic sensor is conveyed to the ThingSpeak cloud.



Components used:  
Ultrasonic sensor  
Buzzer  
Bread Board  
Esp8266(Wi-Fi module) and adapter  
Connecting Wires  
Arduino UNO
